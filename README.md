## About Me

I am a motivated Data Scientist with expertise in Python, SQL, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, data visualization, and handling large datasets. My strong analytical and problem-solving skills enable me to optimize data-driven decision-making.

With a background in mathematics teaching and e-commerce, I bring experience in operational applications and customer satisfaction. Proficient with git-based version control systems (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Gitlab) and CI/CD processes, I transform functions, models, and loops into tangible results, deploying robust data solutions. My solid theoretical knowledge and passion for practical applications drive continuous growth in data science and machine learning.
